# 7sleeping

7sleeping is a quizz solver for the 7Speaking plateform. It exists because of design choices that leak answers to the client.

## Installation

- Once tampermonkey installed and loaded, click on the plugin icon and on "Create a new script..."
- Paste the userscript.js in the code block, Ctrl+S and close

## Demo

Once a quizz started, a button *7sleeping* should appear, once clicked the bot will solve the questions

## How to fix

7sleeping can retrieve the answers from the client because the application uses design that leaks answers.

Take this example, a snippet of react code from an imaginary server:
```javascript
class SecretClass extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.secret = "SecretPassword!";
  }

  render() {
    return <h2>No one can know my secret!</h2>;
  }
}
```

When the render function will be executed, the client will be able to retrieve the whole SecretClass object and its attributes.
```javascript
>> h2_tag.__reactFiber$1hbspvl3m9b.return.elementType.name
"SecretClass" 
>> h2_tag.__reactFiber$1hbspvl3m9b.return.stateNode['secret']
"SecretPassword!" 
```

As we can see, using `return`, we are able to go up the tree and retrieve the initial object SecretClass from the HTML h2 tag.


7sleeping uses a similar approach, retrieving  ̀quizz_div.memoizedProps.return.[...].memoizedProps.answerOptions`, return is used to go up the object tree until finding the key 'answerOptions', which contain the correct answer.
